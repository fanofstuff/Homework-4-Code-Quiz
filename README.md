# Homework-4-Code-Quiz

This program is intended to provide a short and easy quiz regarding common javascript-related questions that one might potentially face in an interview. Notably, this quiz comes with a time limit and an associatated penalty for missed questions, reducing your overall time remaining and final score by 10 points per miss. 

## Intended Usage

According to the user story that came bundled with this project, the intent of this program is to create a simple quiz that the user can then test themselves with. Do note, however, that all of this information is stored in plain text - if they wanted to, the user could just look up the answers with the inspector tool.
